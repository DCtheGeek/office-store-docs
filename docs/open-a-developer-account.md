# Open a developer account in Partner Center

To publish your Office solutions to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), you first need to set up a developer account. You sign up for a developer account using your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work or school account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Microsoft account that you used to sign in to Seller Dashboard, that account will continue to work in Partner Center.

Depending on your scenario, you might be able to use an existing Partner Center developer account. The following table lists the possible developer account scenarios.

|**Scenario**|**Developer account options**|
|:-----------|:-----------------|
|No existing Partner Center program registrations.|Sign up for a new account using your work or school account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your work or school account.|Reuse your existing account or choose to create a new account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your Microsoft account.|Associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account or keep your existing Office developer account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account and you want to register for the Commercial Marketplace program.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account, or sign up for the Commercial Marketplace program with your work or school account and reuse your existing seller account.|

## Before you begin

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create your developer account
You can create an account in one of two ways:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Network Account, [create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, [create an account directly from Partner Center using existing Microsoft Partner Center enrollments]().

### Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page

- Make sure to have your account information handy.

Enrolled in a developer program
If you're already enrolled in a Partner Center developer program, use this section to create your account directly from Partner Center.

 Note

To sign up for the Office Store under the same account you're signed in as, you need to have registered on Partner Center using a Company account. If you signed up with an Individual account, your Office Store enrollment will appear under a new account.

Individual accounts are for single developers working on their own. Company accounts are for organizations and businesses. Company accounts give you access to submit apps with additional functionality. We require greater verification for company accounts after you register to confirm that you're authorized to set up the account for your company. This verification can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company. Both types of accounts allow you to submit apps, add-ins, and services. For more info, see Account types, locations, and fees.

Sign into Partner Center with your Microsoft Partner Center account to enroll into the Office Store program under the same account. By signing up for Office Store using the same account, you can see both your existing program enrollments and Office Store in the left navigation menu of Partner Center.

After you sign in, use the following steps to finish setting up your account:

From Partner Center, select Settings > Developer Settings > Programs > Get Started, and enter your work e-mail address.

Complete the details on the publisher profile page.

Read the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Office Store Agreement, and then select Accept and continue to complete your enrollment.

 Important

You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.

Once enrolled, you're taken to the Office Store Overview page. Office Store is displayed in the left navigation bar. If you select Settings > Developer Settings > Programs, you'll see that Office Store is listed as registered.

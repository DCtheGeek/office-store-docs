# Open a developer account in Partner Center

To publish your Office solutions to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), you first need to set up a developer account. You sign up for a developer account using your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work or school account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Microsoft account that you used to sign in to Seller Dashboard to Partner Center, that account will continue to work in Partner Center.

## Before you begin

To create an account on Partner Center, make sure that you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create your account

Creating your developer account on Partner Center involves the following steps:

- Register on the Partner Center enrollment page.
- Sign in with your work or school account.
- Agree to the terms and conditions.
- Provide your publisher profile.

To create your account:

1. On the [Partner Center Programs] page, under **Recommended programs for you**, Choose the **Get Started** link under Office Add-ins.

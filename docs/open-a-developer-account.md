# Open a developer account in Partner Center

To publish your Office solutions to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), you first need to set up a developer account. You sign up for a developer account using your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work or school account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Microsoft account that you used to sign in to Seller Dashboard, that account will continue to work in Partner Center.

## Before you begin

To create an Office developer account on Partner Center, make sure that you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create your account

To create your account:

1. On the [Partner Center Programs](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/programs) page, under **Recommended programs for you**, Choose the **Get Started** link under Office Add-ins.
2. On the Get started page, choose **Sign in with a work account**.
3. Sign in with your work or school account. This links your work email account domain to your Partner Center account. You will then be able to [add additional users](manage-account-users.md) to your Partner Center account.
4. Choose whether you want Microsoft to share your information with select partners, and then choose **Next**.
4. Provide your company, publisher, and contact information, and choose **Accept and continue**.
    > [!Important]
    > When you choose **Accept and continue**, you also agree to the terms and conditions of the [Office Store Application Provider Agreement]().

Now you're ready to [submit your solutions](use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource) via Partner Center.

# Open a developer account in Partner Center

To publish your Office solutions to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), you first need to set up a developer account. You sign up for a developer account using your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work or school account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Microsoft account that you used to sign in to Seller Dashboard, that account will continue to work in Partner Center.

Depending on your scenario, you might be able to use an existing Partner Center developer account. The following table lists the possible developer account scenarios.

|**Scenario**|**Developer account options**|
|:-----------|:-----------------|
|No existing Partner Center program registrations.|Sign up for a new account using your work or school account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your work or school account.|Reuse your existing account or choose to create a new account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your Microsoft account.|Associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account or keep your existing Office developer account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account and you want to register for the Commercial Marketplace program.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account, or sign up for the Commercial Marketplace program with your work or school account and reuse your existing seller account.|

## Before you begin

To create an Office developer account on Partner Center, make sure that you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create your Partner Center developer account

To create your account:

1. On the [Partner Center Programs](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/programs) page, under **Recommended programs for you**, Choose the **Get Started** link under Office Add-ins.
2. On the Get started page, choose **Sign in with a work account**.
3. Sign in with your work or school account. This links your work email account domain to your Partner Center account. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you link your account domain to your Partner Center account, you will be able to [add additional users](manage-account-users.md) to your account.

4. Choose whether you want Microsoft to share your information with select partners, and then select **Next**.
4. Provide your company, publisher, and contact information, and select **Accept and continue**.
    > [!Important]
    > When you choose **Accept and continue**, you also agree to the terms and conditions of the [Office Store Application Provider Agreement]().

Now you're ready to [submit your solutions](use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource) via Partner Center.

# Manage add-in names in Partner Center

You can use the **Manage product names** page to view all the names that you've reserved for your add-in, reserve additional names (for other languages or to change the name of your add-in), and delete names you don't need. You can find this page in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/office/overview) by expanding the **Product management** section in the left navigation menu for any of your add-ins.

## Reserve additional names for your add-in

You can reserve multiple names to use for the same add-in. This is useful if you're offering your add-in in multiple languages and want to use localized display names for the localized listings. You can also reserve a new name to change the name of your add-in.

To reserve a new name, find the text box in the **Reserve more names** section of the **Manage product names** page. Enter the name you'd like to reserve, then select **Check availability**. If the name is available, select **Reserve product name**. You can reserve multiple names by repeating these steps.

## Delete add-in names

If you no longer want to use a name you previously reserved, you can release it by deleting it on the **Manage product names** page. Make sure you're certain before you do so, because the name will immediately become available for someone else to reserve and use. You can only delete a name if it isnâ€™t in use in any listing.

To delete one of your reserved names, find the name you no longer want to use and then select **Delete**. In the confirmation dialog box, select **Delete** again to confirm.

Note that your add-in must have at least one reserved name. 

## Remove an unpublished add-in
To remove an unpublished add-in from Partner Center (and release all the names you've reserved), select **Delete** on the **Add-in setup** page. Note that if you've already published your add-in to AppSource, you can't delete it from Partner Center. 


## Rename an add-in that has already been published

If your add-in is already in AppSource and you want to rename it, you can do so by reserving a new name for it (as described earlier in this topic) and then creating a new submission for it. 

You must update your add-in package to replace the old name with the new one and upload the updated package to your submission.

To update an AppSource listing to use the new name, go to the [Store listings](office-store-listing.md) page for that language and select the name from the **Product name** dropdown. Be sure to review your description and other parts of the listing for any mentions of the name and make updates if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your app has packages and/or listings in multiple languages, you'll need to update them for every language in which the name needs to be updated.

After your add-in is published with the new name, you can delete any names that you no longer need to use.

> [!TIP]
> Each add-in appears in Partner Center using the first name that you reserved for it. If you've followed these steps to rename an add-in, and you'd like it to appear in Partner Center using the new name, you must delete the original name (by selecting **Delete** on the **Manage app names** page).

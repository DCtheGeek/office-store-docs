# Specify availability for your Office solution

You can define the markets, visibility, and publishing schedule for your solution on the Pricing and availability page in Partner Center.

## Markets

By default, your solution will be available in all markets, including any future markets that are added later. If you don't want your solution to be available in some countries/regions, you can select the markets in which your solution will be available. Choose **Show options** and uncheck the check box next to the market or markets in which you don't want your solution to be available. You can also **Unselect all** markets and then select markets individually.

If you don't want your solution to automatically be made available in future markets, uncheck the **Make my product available in any future market at the base price and general availability date** check box.

> [!NOTE]
> To submit a SharePoint Add-in that uses OAuth and that you want to distribute to China, you must select China only.


## Visibility

By default, your solution will be made available publicly on AppSource. In the Visibility section, you can indicate how customers can discover your solution. You can choose the following options:

- Make this product available and discoverable in marketplace. This is the default option.
- Make this product available but not discoverable in marketplace.

If you choose not to make your solution discoverable in AppSource, you have the following options:

- Make your solution available to customers only via a direct link. This option is appropriate if you want to limit which customers can access your listing.
- Unpublish the solution. When you choose this option, no new customers will be able to acquire your solution. Existing customers will be able to acquire it only until it is unpublished.

## Schedule

By default, your solution will be made available and discoverable in AppSource as soon as possible. If you want to schedule the day and time on which your solution will be discoverable in AppSource, choose **Show options** to specify a release schedule. You have the following options:

- **as soon as possible** - Your solution will be available as soon as it is validated and published.
- **at** - Your solution will be discoverable on the day and time that you specify. You must select the time in UTC. Your solution will be made available at the same time in all markets; you can't customize the availability for different markets.

If you choose not to make your solution discoverable in AppSource, you can't schedule the release date.

## Pricing

Your add-in will be free. For details, see [Moving from paid to free add-ins](moving-from-paid-to-free-addins.md). You can monetize your add-in through the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace; for details, see [Monetize your add-in](monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace.md).

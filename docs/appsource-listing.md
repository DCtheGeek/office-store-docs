# Create your AppSource listing

You enter the AppSource listing information on the Store listings page in Partner Center. For Office Add-ins, this is also the listing that appears in the in-product experience. Your AppSource listing is where you communicate to customers what your solution does and how it can provide value to them. The details are specified per language. You can add multiple languages and localize the following information for each language. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you follow the guidelines in [Create effective AppSource listings](create-effective-office-store-listings.md) when you create your AppSource listing.

## App name
In the **App name** field, specify the title that will be displayed in AppSource. For guidance for titles, see [Use a succinct and descriptive title](create-effective-office-store-listings.md#use-a-succinct-and-descriptive-title).

## Short description and long description

Both the short description and long description appear in the AppSource listing. The short description appears when a user browses or searches within AppSource or the in-product Store. The long description appears on the details page.

**Guidelines for title and description length**

| Item              | Maximum length    | Recommended length    | Include key message in the... |
|:------------------|:------------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------|
| Title             | 50 characters     | 30 characters         |First 30 characters            |
| Short description | 100 characters    | 70 characters         |First 30 characters            |
| Long description  | 4,000 characters  | 300-500 characters    |First 300 characters           |

For additional guidance for descriptions, see [Write compelling descriptions](create-effective-office-store-listings.md#write-compelling-descriptions).

## Screenshots

Your screenshots appear on the AppSource details page and can help draw in potential customers.

At a minimum, you must supply a **Primary** screenshot. You can optionally provide an additional four images. Screenshot images must have a file extention of .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif. Each screenshot must be exactly 1366 pixels wide and 768 pixels high (1366 x 768) and no larger than 1024 KB.

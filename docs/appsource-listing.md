# Create your AppSource listing

You enter the AppSource listing information on the Marketplace listings page in Partner Center. For Office Add-ins, this is also the listing that appears in the in-product experience. Your AppSource listing is where you communicate to customers what your solution does and how it can provide value to them. The details are specified per language. You can add multiple languages and localize the listing information for each language; you must complete an AppSource listing page for at least one language.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you follow the guidelines in [Create effective AppSource listings](create-effective-office-store-listings.md) when you create your AppSource listing.

## Manage languages

You can select the languages in which your solution will be available. Choose **Manage additional languages** and select the check box next to the languages you want. After you select your languages, you can provide AppSource listing information for each language.

For details about offering solution in multiple languages, see [Prepare localized add-ins](prepare-localized-apps-and-add-ins.md).

## Create your listing

Select a language to add the AppSource listing information for that language. Your listing includes the following information.

### Display name
In the **Display name** field, specify the name of the solution that will be displayed in AppSource. For details, see [Manage names](manage-add-in-names.md).

### Short and long descriptions

Both the short description and long description appear in the AppSource listing. The short description appears when a user browses or searches within AppSource or the in-product experience. The long description appears on the details page for your solution.

**Guidelines for descriptions**

| Item              | Maximum length    | Recommended length    | Include key message in the... |
|:------------------|:------------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------|
| Short description | 100 characters    | 70 characters         |First 30 characters            |
| Description       | 4,000 characters  | 300-500 characters    |First 300 characters           |

For additional guidance for descriptions, see [Write compelling descriptions](create-effective-office-store-listings.md#write-compelling-descriptions).

### Search terms

Add keywords related to your solution that customers will use in search queries in AppSource. You can add up to three terms, and they can be words or short phrases, with a maximum of 40 characters each, for a total of 21 words across all seven entries.

As a best practice, choose search terms that are not part of your solution name. Don't choose terms that aren't relevant to your solution.

### Screenshots

Your screenshots appear on the AppSource details page and can help draw in potential customers.

You must provide at least one screenshot; we recommend that you provide at least four screenshots for each device family that your solution supports. Each screenshot must be 1366 pixels wide and 768 pixels high (1366 x 768) and no larger than 50 MB. Screenshots must be .png files.

You can also provide a short caption of up to 200 characters that describes each screenshot.

For guidance for creating compelling screenshots, see [Craft effective AppSource images](craft-effective-appsource-store-images.md).

### Logo

You can upload a logo that you would like to associate with your AppSource listing. Your logo must be a .png file and must be 300 x 300 pixels, and no larger than 50 MB.

### Additional information

You can provide a link to a video about your solution. Your URL must include https://. AppSource supports YouTube and Vimeo video links.

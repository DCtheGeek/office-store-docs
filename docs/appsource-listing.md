# Create your AppSource listing

You enter the AppSource listing information on the Store listings page in Partner Center. For Office Add-ins, this is also the listing that appears in the in-product experience. Your AppSource listing is where you communicate to customers what your solution does and how it can provide value to them. The details are specified per language. You can add multiple languages and localize the listing information for each language. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you follow the guidelines in [Create effective AppSource listings](create-effective-office-store-listings.md) when you create your AppSource listing.

## Add languages

Choose **Manage additional languages** and select the check box next to the languages in which your add-in will be available. After you select your languages, you can provide store listing information for each language.

## Display name
In the **Display name** field, specify the name of the add-in that will be displayed in AppSource. For details, see [Manage add-in names](manage-add-in-names.md).

## Short description and description

Both the short description and description appear in the AppSource listing. The short description appears when a user browses or searches within AppSource or the in-product experience. The description appears on the details page for your add-in.

# Reserve a name for your add-in

To create a submission in Partner Center, the first step is to reserve a name. Names must be unique throughout AppSource.

We recommmend that you reserve your name even if you haven't developed your add-in yet, so that another developer doesn't use your name. Note, however, that you'll need to submit your add-in within three months in order to keep the name that you reserved.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can reserve additional names for an app, and you may choose to use one of those in the published version of your app instead of the one you reserve when you first create your app in Partner Center. However, be aware that the first name you enter here will be used in some of your app's [identity details](view-app-identity-details.md), such as the **Package Family Name (PFN)**. These values may be visible to some users, and cannot be changed, so make sure that the name you reserve is appropriate for this use.

## Reserve your add-in name

1.  From the **Overview** page, select **Create a new...**.
2.  In the text box, enter the name that you want to use, and then select **Check availability**. 
    If the name is available, you'll see a green check mark. 
    If the name you entered is already reserved or in use by another developer, you'll see a message that the name is not available.
3.  Select **Reserve product name**.

The name is now reserved for you, and you can start working on your submission whenever you're ready. 

For guidelines for add-in names, see our [title guidelines](create-effective-office-store-listings.md#use-a-succinct-and-descriptive-title).

> [!NOTE]
> You might find that you can't reserve a name, even though you don't see any apps listed by that name in AppSource. This is usually because another developer has reserved the name but hasn't submitted it yet. If you're unable to reserve a name for which you hold the trademark or other legal right, or if you see another app in AppSource using that name, [contact Microsoft](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233777).

After you reserve a name, you have three months to submit your solution. If you don't submit it within three months, the name reservation will expire, and another developer can use that name. You might encounter an error if you try to submit an add-in with a name that has expired.

# Update or unpublish your add-in in Seller Dashboard

After you submit your solution to the Seller Dashboard, you might want to update them or remove (unpublish) them from AppSource listings. You can also delete your submissions from the Seller Dashboard. You can use metrics in the Seller Dashboard to evaluate how your solutions are performing.

2. On the **Manage** tab, select the item that you want to edit.

3. On the summary page, if you want to edit a draft item, select **EDIT DRAFT**. If you're editing an approved item, select **EDIT LISTING**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you edit an approved item and submit it, it goes through the approval process again. 

4. In the Edit App Wizard, make the changes that you want.
 
5. Select **SAVE AS DRAFT** if you are not ready to submit, or select **SUBMIT FOR APPROVAL** to submit your item.

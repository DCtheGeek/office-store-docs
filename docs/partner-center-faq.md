# Partner Center migration FAQ

Microsoft is rolling out a modern management experience for the Office Store program in Partner Center. Office Add-ins (including Outlook add-ins), SharePoint add-ins, Teams apps, and Power BI visuals will be migrated to Partner Center. This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the migration.

## When will the move to Partner Center happen for me?
The order in which a partner will be moved will depend on the type, quantity, and metadata complexity of the products in their account. We will bundle like accounts together and adjust the order as needed. A partner account might be moved on any day during the moving period.

## Are there actions I need to take before the move?
No action is required from you before migration. However, we do recommend that you use the opportunity to clean up obsolete draft products in Seller Dashboard to have a clean start in Partner Center.

## Can I still access Seller Dashboard and mange my products during the move?
For most of the process, you’ll be able to access Seller Dashboard as usual; however, during the final step of the move, there will be a brief period during which Seller Dashboard access will be locked and you will not be able to view or edit any products until the move is complete. This will take 10 – 30 minutes on average. In rare cases where migration takes longer than 2 hours, we might opt to revert you back to Seller Dashboard until the blocking issue is resolved. Note: Any changes not saved prior to the move will be lost.

## Can I still access Seller Dashboard after my products are moved to Partner Center?
After the move to Partner Center, you will start managing your products exclusively through Partner Center. Seller Dashboard will no longer be accessible.

## Will all my products on Seller Dashboard be moved to Partner Center?
We will move all the following products from Seller Dashboard to Partner Center:

- Office add-ins
- Outlook add-ins
- SharePoint add-ins
- Teams apps
- Power BI visuals

We will also move client IDs and associated secrets for which the secrets have not expired.

All other products will not be migrated. These are legacy products that are no longer supported in Seller Dashboard.

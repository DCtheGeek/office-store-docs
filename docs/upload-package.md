# Upload your package to AppSource

On the **Packages** page in Partner Center, drag or select your add-in manifest file for your Office or SharePoint add-in to upload it.

To remove or replace your add-in package, choose **Remove** in the **Action** column.

When you upload your manifest file, you might get one of the following messages:

- **Manifest errors**. If your manifest contains errors, Partner Center reports those errors and you have to resolve them before you can submit your add-in.
- **Applications and platforms supported**. Office add-ins, platforms, and operating systems are specified in the **Requirements** element in your manifest. Your add-in will be validated against all the applications and platforms listed. For more information, see [Office Add-in host and platform availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-in-availability).

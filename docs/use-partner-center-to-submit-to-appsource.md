# Submit your Office solution to AppSource via Partner Center

If you want your Office solution to appear in AppSource, you need to submit it to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft-int.com/en-us/dashboard/office/products) for approval. First, familiarize yourself with the [AppSource validation policies](validation-policies.md). 

If your SharePoint Add-in requires an Open Authorization (OAuth) client ID and client secret, see [Create or update client IDs and secrets in Partner Center](create-or-update-client-ids-and-secrets.md).

For information about the AppSource approval process, see [Make your solutions available in AppSource](submit-to-the-office-store.md).

## Submission checklist

Submitting your solution involves specifying your solution name and adding your solution details via Partner Center.

### Create your solution and reserve name

On the [Overview](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/office/overview) page in Partner Center, select **Create a new...**, and select the type of solution that you are submitting:

- Office add-in
- SharePoint solution
- Power BI visual
- Microsoft Teams app

In the dialog box, provide a name for your solution and choose **Check availability** to verify that the name is available. For details, see [Reserve a name](reserve-solution-name.md).

After you've verified that the name you chose is available, choose **Create**.

### Add your submission details

On the Product overview page, add the details associated with your submission. The following table lists the tasks that you need to complete.

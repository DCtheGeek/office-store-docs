# Set pricing and availability

You can define the markets for your add-in on the **Pricing and availability** page in AppSource.

## Markets

By default, your add-in will be available in all markets, including any future markets that are added later. If you don't want your add-in to be available in some countries/regions, you can select the markets in which your add-in will be available. Choose **Show options** and uncheck the check box next to the market or markets in which you don't want your add-in to be available. You can also **Unselect all** markets and then select markets individually.

If you don't want your add-in to automatically be made available in future markets, uncheck the **Make my product available in any future market at the base price and general availability date** check box.

> [!NOTE]
> To submit a SharePoint Add-in that uses OAuth and that you want to distribute to China, you must select China only.


## Visibility

## Schedule

By default, your add-in will be made available in ApSource as soon as possible. If you want to schedule the day and time on which your add-in will be made available, choose **at** in the dropdown and set the date and time at which you want your add-in to be availble. You must select the time in UTC. Your add-in will be made available at the same time in all markets; you can't customize the availability for different markets.

## Pricing

Your add-in will be free. For details, see [Moving from paid to free add-ins](moving-from-paid-to-free-addins.md). You can monetize your add-in through the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace; for details, see [Monetize your add-in](monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace.md).

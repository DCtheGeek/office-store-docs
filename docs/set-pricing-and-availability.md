# Set pricing and availability

You can define the markets, visibility, and publishing schedule for your add-in on the Pricing and availability page in Partner Center.

## Markets

By default, your add-in will be available in all markets, including any future markets that are added later. If you don't want your add-in to be available in some countries/regions, you can select the markets in which your add-in will be available. Choose **Show options** and uncheck the check box next to the market or markets in which you don't want your add-in to be available. You can also **Unselect all** markets and then select markets individually.

If you don't want your add-in to automatically be made available in future markets, uncheck the **Make my product available in any future market at the base price and general availability date** check box.

> [!NOTE]
> To submit a SharePoint Add-in that uses OAuth and that you want to distribute to China, you must select China only.


## Visibility

By default, your add-in will be made available publicly on AppSource. In the Visibility section, you can indicate how customers can discover your add-in. You can choose the following options:

- Make this product available and discoverable in marketplace. This is the default option.
- Make this product available but not discoverable in marketplace.

If you choose not to make your add-in discoverable in AppSource, you have the following options:

- Make your add-in available to customers only via a direct link. This option is appropriate if you want to limit which customers can access your add-in listing.
- Unpublish the add-in. When you choose this option, no new customers will be able to acquire your add-in. Existing customers will be able to acquire it only until it is unpublished.

## Schedule

By default, your add-in will be made available in ApSource as soon as possible. If you want to schedule the day and time on which your add-in will be made available, choose **Show options** to specify at release schedule. You have the following options:

- **as soon as possible** - Your add-in will be avaialable as soon as it is validated and published.
- **at** - Your add-in will be available on the day and time that you specify. You must select the time in UTC. Your add-in will be made available at the same time in all markets; you can't customize the availability for different markets.

If you choose not to make your add-in discoverable in AppSource, you can't choose to schedule when it will be published.

## Pricing

Your add-in will be free. For details, see [Moving from paid to free add-ins](moving-from-paid-to-free-addins.md). You can monetize your add-in through the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace; for details, see [Monetize your add-in](monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace.md).

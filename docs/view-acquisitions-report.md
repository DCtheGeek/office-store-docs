# View the Acquisitions report in the dashboard

The Acquisitions report in the Dev Center dashboard lets you see who has acquired and installed your add-in, app or visual, and shows info about how customers have arrived at your AppSource listing. 

In this report, an acquisition means a new customer has obtained a license to your solution (whether you charged money or you've offered it for free). If your solution supports multi-seat acquisitions, such as site license purchases, these will also be detailed and displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Acquisitions report does not include data about refunds, reversals, chargebacks, etc. To estimate your solution proceeds, visit Payout summary.

## Acquisitions

The **Acquisitions** chart shows the number of daily or weekly acquisitions (a new customer obtaining a license for your app) over the selected period of time.

You can also see the lifetime number of acquisitions for your app by selecting App cumulative. This shows the cumulative total of all acquisitions, starting from when your app was first published.

The values supported within the Acquisitions chart include:

- Free - Webstore: Free acquisitions generated in web surfaces such as AppSource.

- Free - Client: Free acquisitions generated in store surfaces within the Office Apps. This includes Windows, Mac and Office Online.

- Paid: These are paid acquisitions, and may be either perpetual or subscription based on your solution's payment model.

- Trial: These are trial acquisitions. Length and expiration of these trial acquisitions are based on your selected trial lengths during the store submission process.

- Site License: These are paid acquisitions where an entire tenant is provisioned with a license.

- Deployment: These are the number of tenants who have deployed your solution. One tenant deployment here may generate multiple assignments. For the amount of end-users who received a license for your solution, please see the Assignments chart.

## Markets

The **Markets** chart shows the total number of acquisitions over the selected period of time for each market in which your solution is available.

You can view this data in a visual Map form, or toggle the setting to view it in Table form. Table form will show five markets at a time, sorted either alphabetically or by highest/lowest number of acquisitions. You can also download the data to view info for all markets together.
